## Problem

Write a program to find the sum of all the numbers in the array that are multiples of 3.

### Input Format
- The first line contains an integer, $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test contain two lines of inputs: The first line contains a positive integer $N$ - the length of the array. Second line of each test case contains $N$ space separated integers - the elements of the array.
### Output Format
- For each test case, print on the new line : sum of the $3$'s multiples present in the array
### Constraints
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 20
- 1 ≤ Length of each array ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ Elements of each array ≤ 1000
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
2
4
1 2 3 9
5
1 2 4 5 7
```

```
12
0
```

### Explanation:

The first array [1, 2, 3, 9] contains two multiples of 3: 3 and 9. Their sum = 12.
The second array [1, 2, 4, 5, 7] doesn't contain any multiple of 3, hence sum = 0.

```c_cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Update your code here.
    int t;
    cin>>t;
    while(t--){
        int n,sum=0;
        cin>>n;
        int arr[n];
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            cin>>arr[i];
            if(arr[i]%3==0){
                sum+=arr[i];
            }
        }
        cout<<sum<<endl;
    }
    return 0;
}

```
